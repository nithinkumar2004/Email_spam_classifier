# 📧 Email Spam Classifier

An advanced machine-learning-based Email Spam Classifier to detect and filter spam emails accurately.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust email spam classification system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The classifier distinguishes between spam and non-spam (ham) emails.

### ✨ Features
- Spam vs. Ham email classification
- Preprocessing of email content (e.g., removing stop words, punctuation)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Supports visualization of performance metrics

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 🛠️ Libraries Used
```
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

## 📊 Model Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Load and preprocess email datasets.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF).
3. **Model Training**: Use classification models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
4. **Evaluation**: Analyze accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `email_spam_classifier.ipynb` and run the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Example Output

## 🧪 Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or FastAPI
- Enhance dataset with more real-world examples
